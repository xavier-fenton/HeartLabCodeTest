# HeartLab Coding Test - Writeup

*TODO: complete this technical writeup, details are in the README.md file*

## Instructions

## Architectural Summary & Justification
<!-- 
written functionally, rather than oop
for loops rather than array.methods for loops control of flow, follow up with benchmarking?

Introduce strong typing? -> ensure data sanitisation (part of scalabilty)

 -->

## Scalability

<!--  Create a log file that catches errors and writes them to the file 
 Possibly introduce schema types for strong typing of the data being recieved 
 for instance if the api schema were to change eg: 
(current data looks like 
    {
      name: "Mayo Clinic",
      openingHours: ["Mon-Sun 8am to 9pm"]
    }
  The purpose of introducing strong types would insure that we could match that the values havent changed, but and edge case could be the data api object keys have change, as api can change.
